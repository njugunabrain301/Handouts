            <p>We are here to promote learning via an online platform offering all-inclusive learning materials ranging from handouts, exam materials, abstracts, course outline, lecture timetables for all courses.
It is easy to see what we are doing; making study material available to all Egerton students anywhere any time at extremely low prices. But the real question is, why are we doing it? We are a group of three Egerton students who noticed how much we struggle to find handouts and exam papers and thought: there has to be a better way to do this. And there was!
So, we started working on our site. It was a long journey coming up with the name, what features to add and incooperating all our ideas together so that they actually make something sensible. With the help of CoElib, we were able to expand our brand to accommodate masters and PHD students.</p>
<p>Now you no longer have to move from cyber to cyber looking for handouts. Just log in and you have access to everything about your particular course or unit. Things have never been easier!Our project aims to promote learning by making study materials easily accessible to students in soft copy and at an affordable price. Online access to learning materials will encourage students to study even before lectures resume and at the same time reduce littering of the environment by eliminating hardcopies.
In all aspects, we have worked tirelessly to ensure the greater Egerton population is addressed and are going to be beneficiaries of this milestone project. We have therefore availed learning materials via our online platform catering for both under-graduate and post-graduate students.</p>
